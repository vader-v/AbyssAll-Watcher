## AbyssAll Watcher!
_A Genshin-Impact Team Builder/ Social application_

AbyssAll Watcher is an application built for genshin impact users. As a daily Genshin Impact player one might have more than 25 teams that they want to keep saved at a given time, yet the game itself will only allow 10 slots. I've took it upon myself to supply the userbase with a helpful applicaton meant to assist in Spiral Abyss Content. When comparing the new state of the abyss to your current teams, you may find yourself running back and forth through menus to look at all of your teams. Look no further since all of your created teams will be stored for easy access.

## How to use my app
First you should direct yourself to the create-team page via the nav bar, create a new name for a team, and select four characters to be included in the team. Push the create team button and you will be redirected to your profile. After a team is created you can access the View Teams page via the nav bar. You are able to edit and delete the teams on this page as you please. I hope you enjoy storing your future teams with my application!
